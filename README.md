## Stack

*API*

- express.js
- sequelize.js

*React client*

- Built using `create-react-app` and configured to work with the api.
- Bootstrap 4.x added to `/client/public/index.html`
- React Router

## Dev Setup

Each team member will need to do this on their local machine.

### Create a postgres db

Create a user in postgres named `residentccny` with the password `ccnypassword`:

> This only needs to be done one time on your machine
> You can create additional users if you want to.

```
createuser -P -s -e residentccny
```

Create a separate db for this project:

```
createdb -h localhost -U residentccny residentccny_development
```

> You will create a DB for each project you start based on this repo. For other projects change `residentccny_development` to the new apps database name.

*For more details see this [installing postgres guide](https://github.com/CUNYTechPrep/ctp2019/blob/master/guides/installing-postgresql.md)*

### Running the app

For local development you will need two terminals open, one for the api-backend and another for the react-client.

*Clone* this app, then:

```bash
# api-backend terminal 1
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
# react-client terminal 2
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

- api-backend will launch at: http://localhost:8080
- react-client will launch at: http://localhost:3000

> In production you will only deploy a single app. The react client will build into static files that will be served from the backend.

## Deployment

### Setting up Heroku

Install the heroku cli if you don't already have it. 

> You will also need a heroku account
> And this will only be done once on your machine

```bash
# on mac
brew install heroku/brew/heroku
heroku login
```

### Create a Heroku project

Next, `cd` into this project directory and create a project:

```bash
heroku create cool-appname
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```

> This will deploy your apps to https://cool-appname.herokuapp.com, assuming that it is not taken already.

> You only need to do this once per app

### Deploying the app

Whenever you want to update the app run this command.

```bash
git push heroku master
```

> This command deploys your master branch. You can change that and deploy a different branch such as: `git push heroku development`
